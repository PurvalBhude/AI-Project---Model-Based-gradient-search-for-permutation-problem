## üß† Abstract

Permutation problems are tough due to the lack of gradient information. This project introduces a **model-based gradient approach** using the **Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution** to define a differentiable probability model over permutations. The model is iteratively improved through **gradient ascent** on the expected objective value.

We implemented and analyzed various enhancements including:
- Cumulative Step-size Adaptation (CSA)
- Entropy-based sampling
- Utility-based objective transformation
- Soft restarts to escape local optima
- Natural gradients for better convergence

## üß© Key Concepts

### üîπ Problem Motivation
- Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) lack direct gradient information.
- The solution: **Model a differentiable probability distribution** over permutations.
- Apply gradient-based optimization to the distribution‚Äôs parameters to sample better solutions over time.

### üîπ Why Plackett-Luce?
- Probability model for ranking items.
- Efficient sampling: $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
- Gradient computation: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Parameterized using an n-length vector `$z$`, representing scores for items.
